Package: rde
Title: Reproducible Data Embedding
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Stefan", "Kloppenborg", email = "stefan.kloppenborg@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Allows caching of raw data directly in R code. This allows R
  scripts and R Notebooks to be shared and re-run on a machine without access
  to the original data. Cached data is encoded into an ASCII string that can
  be pasted into R code. When the code is run, the data is automatically
  loaded from the cached version if the original data file is unavailable.
  Works best for small datasets (a few hundred observations).
Depends: R (>= 3.1)
